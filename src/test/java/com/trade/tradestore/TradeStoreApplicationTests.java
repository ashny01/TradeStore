// This class is used to ensure that the Spring application context loads correctly
// during tests. It excludes MongoDB auto-configuration and sets the Kafka bootstrap server for testing
// purposes. The test method `contextLoads` is empty, as its purpose is to verify that the application context can start without any issues.
// This is a common practice in Spring Boot applications to ensure that the application can start up correctly
// and that all necessary beans are configured properly. The `@SpringBootTest` annotation is used to indicate that this is a Spring Boot test class, and it will load the application context for testing.
// The properties specified in the `@SpringBootTest` annotation are used to configure the test environment, such as excluding certain auto-configurations and setting the Kafka bootstrap server address.
// The `contextLoads` method is a simple test that checks if the application context can be loaded without any exceptions.
// If the application context fails to load, the test will fail, indicating that there is an issue with the application configuration or dependencies.
// This is a basic setup for testing a Spring Boot application, ensuring that the application can start up correctly and that all necessary components are available for further testing.
// It serves as a foundation for more complex tests that can be added later to verify the functionality of the application.
// The `@SpringBootTest` annotation is a powerful feature of Spring Boot that allows for integration testing by loading the entire application context, making it easier to test the application as a whole.
//// This test class can be expanded with additional tests to verify specific functionalities of the application, such as
